- Create a free account on N8N.
- On the open canvas, connect a chat prompt to an AI Agent.
- Select a model for the agent -- ex, OpenAI chat model.
- Provide the smart home device to control as the 'Tool' to the agent.

### Lecture 3

Setup of environment -
- [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) - AI forward IDE based on VSCode.
- [UV Package Manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) - Similar to Anaconda built on top of virtual
environments.

API costs - Given the use of LLM, we will incur API costs. Free alternatives such as Ollama might not produce
comparable results to OpenAI models for ex. See [pricing for OpenAI models](https://openai.com/api/pricing/).

### Lecture 4

Setting up environment for PC. See [this guide](../source_material/agents/README.md).
The lecture talks about cloning the repo, but I am using it as a submodule. After the setup
of the repo, install Cursor (NA - will use VSCode) and UV.

Installing `uv` steps taken -
- Installed using powershell as in [this guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). Restart VSCode.
- Go to the `agents` subm directory.
- `uv sync`
